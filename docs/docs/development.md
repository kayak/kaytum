## Building

To build run:

```bash
npm run build
```

We are enforcing size limits with [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit), so that we keep the cost of using
this library in check.

## Linting

We use eslint with [@typescript-eslint/parser](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) as our linter
tool. To lint run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

## Testing

We use [jest](https://jestjs.io/) as our test framework. To execute the entire test suite run:

```bash
npm run test
npm run test:watch
npm run test:coverage
```

## Documentation

We use [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) as our documentation framework. To see the documentation in dev mode run:

```bash
npm run docs:watch
```

Before generating the documentation, we are injecting API markdown files created with [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/),
as a way to document the code per se.

## Changelog

We use [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) as our automated
changelog/release notes generator. To generate a changelog file run:

```bash
npm run changelog
```

We don't commit changelog files though and this should only be used for testing purposes. Partial changelogs will
be transparently used as the description of new github releases, when publishing a version.

## Deploying & Publishing

To publish a new package on [NPM](http://npmjs.com) run:

```bash
npm run release
```

Besides publishing the package, the command above will build the package, bump its version, commit that, tag the
new version and push commits/tags to github and then create a github release. This process is automatically handled by
[lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). To publish the documentation on github pages run:

```bash
npm run release:docs
```

It might take some time for github pages to update its caches once docs are deployed, so be patient.
