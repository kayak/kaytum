# Introduction

Opinionated, Redux abstraction with built-in immutability, async and more. Heavily dva inspired.

## Installing

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install react-resux react-resux-hooks --save
```

Using yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add react-resux react-resux-hooks
```

Naturally, the react-resux-hooks package is optional, in case you're willing to use our hooks API.

## Benefits

* Easy to use and learn. Only a few public interfaces (i.e. combineModelReducers, resuxRootSaga, Model, connectResux or equivalent hooks).
* Boilerplate reduction (i.e. actions, dispatchers, reducers).
* Immutability with normal JavaScript objects and arrays. No new APIs to learn!
* Async, typescript, memoised selectors, and hooks support.
* Tiny footprint (i.e. ~6KB).
